# OOBD - The Open Onboard Diagnostics Toolkit

OOBD (Open On Board Diagnostics) is a collection of open Source software and hardware for OBD Vehicle Diagnostics. Our target is to provide a flexible platform to do the most diagnostic tasks quick, handy and reliable. To do so, we've developed a whole set of applications, hardware and tools - and we still continue..

# Quickstart

To download, install, setup and run the software, please follow the instructions for [Android](http://oobd.org/doku.php?id=doc:startup_android) or [Windows](http://oobd.org/doku.php?id=doc:startup_windows).

For all documents, please use the links [Sitemap](http://oobd.org/doku.php?id=start&do=index) and [Manual](http://oobd.org/doku.php?id=doc:start) provided in the header of each page.

# Features
As the feature list became to long for the main page, we moved it to the separate [Feature](http://oobd.org/doku.php?id=web:features) page.

# Hardware

Although the build plans are available in the OOBD repository, we do recommend to better buy a finished CAN invader device at our partner [JATRA](http://caninvader.com/). It was found that there's a lot of experience and time needed to collect all parts and to solder the dongle by yourself. Especially for commercial applications it's more effective to directly order the complete units.
